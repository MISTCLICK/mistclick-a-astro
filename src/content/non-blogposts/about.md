# About me

_(Updated September 2023)_

## A little background

My initials are A.V.; I prefer not to disclose my full name unless there is a reason to. I am from Rīga, the capital of Latvia. I've lived my whole life here, but at the moment I'm looking to study abroat after I finish school in the spring of 2024. _Hopefully I won't forget to update this page as time goes by._ 😅 I am really passionate about all the things I do. Studies, work, hobbies: give it all to me. I love to explore, learn, and find out new things. I am keen on finding new friends and experiences.

## My abilities, qualifications, and experience

Unfortunately, I don't have any official educational qualifications as of yet, however, here are some of my achievements and plans for the future:

- I am graduating an engineering-focused secondary school programme in 2024.
- I am working on a scientific research paper in computer science. `THE INFLUENCE OF AI HELP ON THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN PROBLEM SOLVING` (originally in latvian: `MĀKSLĪGĀ INTELEKTA PALĪDZĪBAS IETEKME UZ CILVĒKA PROBLĒMRISINĀŠANAS PRODUKTIVITĀTI UN EFEKTIVITĀTI`). It is due to be completed in 2024.
- I am really into physics and I have multiple city and state level awards for physics olympiads and competitions.
- My preferred programming languages are TypeScript and Python. I am mostly focused on web development, but I do have limited game dev experience with Unity/C#. At the moment, Next.js is my go-to full-stack tool. I prever SQL databases, but I've also got experience with MongoDB and Redis (as cache and as DB). I also have experience working on electrol apps, to be honest had a lot of fun with that and would love to touch electron again.
- Next year I am hoping to get into SDU - University of Southern Denmark, BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) in Mechatronics.

## My interests and interesting facts about me

I am fascinated with aviation for many years already. I love spending time studying aircraft systems in-depth and exploring differences in airspace structures around the world. To greater enhance my experience I started simulating flights on my home PC, _gosh, I was 5 back then_. Later I joined the VATSIM network and started to explore the "other side of the radar" and joined Latvia vACC to go through another learning journey. Now I hold a C1 rating and frequently participate in events and other stuff on the network.

VATSIM is a 100% volunteer organisation. All of its 100 000+ members work and spend their time completely for free, because we all have one common goal: **Aviate. Educate. Communicate. ✈️** [To find out more about my experience with VATSIM and the network in general](/blog/a-bit-about-vatsim).
