# About me

_(Updated September 2023)_

## A little background

My initials are A.V.; I prefer not to disclose my full name unless there is a reason to. I am from Rƒ´ga, the capital of Latvia. I've lived my whole life here, but at the moment I'm looking to study abroad after I finish school in the spring of 2024. _Hopefully I won't forget to update this page as time goes by._ üòÖ I am really passionate about all the things I do. Studies, work, hobbies: give it all to me. I love to explore, learn, and find out new things. I am keen on finding new friends and experiences.

## My abilities, qualifications, and experience

Unfortunately, I don't have any official educational qualifications as of yet, however, here are some of my achievements and plans for the future:

- I am graduating an engineering-focused secondary school programme in 2024.
- I am working on a scientific research paper in computer science: `THE INFLUENCE OF AI HELP ON THE PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HUMAN PROBLEM SOLVING` (originally in Latvian: _`MƒÄKSLƒ™GƒÄ INTELEKTA PALƒ™DZƒ™BAS IETEKME UZ CILVƒíKA PROBLƒíMRISINƒÄ≈†ANAS PRODUKTIVITƒÄTI UN EFEKTIVITƒÄTI`_). It is due to be completed in 2024.
- I am really into physics and I have multiple city and state-level awards for physics olympiads and competitions.
- My preferred programming languages are TypeScript and Python. I started out working on Discord bots with discord.js and discord.py, but now I am mostly focused on web development. I do also have limited game dev experience with Unity/C#. At the moment, Next.js is my go-to full-stack tool. I prefer SQL databases, but I've also got experience with MongoDB and Redis (as cache and as DB). I also have experience working on electron apps, to be honest had a lot of fun with that and would love to touch electron again.
- Next year I am hoping to get into SDU - University of Southern Denmark, BEng (Bachelor of Engineering) in Mechatronics.

## My interests and some facts about me

I am fascinated with aviation for many years already. I love spending time studying aircraft systems in-depth and exploring differences in airspace structures around the world. To greater enhance my experience I started simulating flights on my home PC, _gosh, I was 5 back then_. Later I joined the VATSIM network and started to explore the "other side of the radar" and joined Latvia vACC to go through another learning journey. Now I hold a C1 rating and frequently participate in events and other stuff on the network.

VATSIM is a 100% volunteer organisation. All of its 100 000+ members work and spend their time completely for free, because we all have one common goal: **Aviate. Educate. Communicate. ‚úàÔ∏è** [To find out more about my experience with VATSIM and the network in general click here](/blog/a-bit-about-vatsim).

I am a perfectionist and sometimes that trait of mine becomes unreasonable. That made me an A\* student for my whole life (well, Latvia uses 1-10 grading system, and for many years getting a 10 was my only goal). I am fluent in 3 languages: Latvian, English, and Russian. I am also somewhat experienced with Esperanto.

## My free time and taste

I spend most of my free time jumping between different sources of information. By that I mean that a Google search about Elizabeth II can go down a rabbit hole and turn into me reading about the mission of Voyager 1. I also read a lot of non-scientific literature. My favourite authors and books are:

- Jules Verne, literally any book of his for me is a masterpiece
- A book series called "39 clues" by various authors
- "Professor Dowell's Head" (Russian: _"–ì–æ–ª–æ–≤–∞ –ø—Ä–æ—Ñ–µ—Å—Å–æ—Ä–∞ –î–æ—É—ç–ª—è"_) by Alexander Belyaev

I will also list some of my musical preferences here, because why not:

- pyrokinesis (Russian: _–ø–∏—Ä–æ–∫–∏–Ω–µ–∑–∏—Å_)
- Rewind (Russian: _–ü–µ—Ä–µ–º–æ—Ç–∫–∞_)
- Electrophoresis (Russian: _–≠–ª–µ–∫—Ç—Ä–æ—Ñ–æ—Ä–µ–∑_)
- Owl (Russian: _–°–æ–≤–∞_)
- Give Us A Tank (!) (Russian: _–î–∞–π—Ç–µ —Ç–∞–Ω–∫ (!)_)
- Bad Taste (Russian: _–î—É—Ä–Ω–æ–π –í–∫—É—Å_)
- M√•neskin
- Lana Del Rey
- Muse
- Alec Benjamin
- Depeche Mode
- Linkin Park
- Imagine Dragons
- girl in red
- Billie Eilish

Oh yeah. I also love coffee and I am very meticulous about it. I am a picky eater and can consume anything at the same time somehow.

## My vision for life

I want to try out, see, experience as much as I can. Travelling the world, eating new foods, meeting new people - I love all of it. Well, maybe I am a little cautious with people at times, but in general it's fine. Regardless of what awaits me, I want to pursue every opportunity that life presents me and learn as many skills as I can.

For now, that's it.

Let the skies be clear. ‚úàÔ∏è
