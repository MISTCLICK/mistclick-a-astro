Modern day secondary and higher education is an interesting part of life and the academic journey of anyone and everyone. However, one of the things that overlap in so many areas of education is _the scientific method_. It's been around for many centuries now and is still one the strongest standing pillars of modern research. Many secondary education programmes around the world now include said method as part of preparation for further steps in education and, in my opinion, that's a good thing. Luckily, my home country of Latvia also introduced teaching the scientific method in its secondary education programme 2 years ago.

While it is important to recognise that different academic environments employ different approaches to teaching the scientific method, this article will specifically focus on the one that is applied in Latvia in the last 2 years of secondary school. In short, to complete secondary education students are required to complete and defend a research project in terms of a multi-subject course "Project work" _(latv. Projekta darbs)_. The students are free to choose one of 4 types of research: scientific, entrepreneurial, design and technology, or public/societal.
