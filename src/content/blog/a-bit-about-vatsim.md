## What's VATSIM?

The Virtual Air Traffic Simulation Network [(VATSIM)](https://vatsim.net) has been one of my most important sources of inspiration for quite some time now. It is a complicated network of more than 100 000 members that I am a part of. We as members are trying to simulate all aspects of modern civil aviation with utmost precision. I am really happy to be a member of the VATSIM community. I basically have 3 separate lives: a real life, a dev life and a VATSIM life. On this page and in my blog you'll find some details about my life on the network besides my other thoughts and ideas.

## VATSIM and me

There are 2 ways you can interract with VATSIM: flying as a _Pilot_ or controlling as an _Air Traffic Controller_. I don't fly much these days, I mostly spend my time controlling.

I am a member of the Latvian part of the network - [Latvia vACC.](https://lv-vacc.org) I am also an ATC (Air Traffic Control) instructor/examiner for all permanent ratings S1 <-> C1. [My VATSIM stats are available _here_ (network members only)](https://stats.vatsim.net/stats/1433887)

If you'd like to support me and our community, follow [_Latvia vACC on X_](https://x.com/EVRR_FIR) or [_Join Latvia vACC_](https://lv-vacc.org).

Let the skies be clear. ✈️
