## Welcome to my blog/shitposting page <br>which also functions as my business card.

You can call me A.V. I am a full-stack developer who is fascinated with aviation.

On this web page you may find anything and everything about me, my interests and my dev experience. I guess I will also use this as my open diary to the world. Hope you find the informaiton here helpful, regardless of the reason why you are here. For now, Hello World. ðŸ’–
